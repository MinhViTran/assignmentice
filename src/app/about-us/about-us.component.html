        <p class="font-weight-bold text-centre">In 1857, Tom Wills, one of the founders of Australian Football, returned
            to Australia after schooling in England
            where he was football captain of Rugby School and a brilliant cricketer. Initially, he advocated the winter
            game of football as a way of keeping
            cricketers fit during off-season.</p>
        <p>The new game was devised by Wills, his cousin H.C.A. Harrison, W.J. Hammersley and J.B. Thompson.
            The Melbourne Football Club was formed on August 7, 1858 – the year of the code's first recorded
            match between Scotch College and Melbourne Grammar School.</p>
        <p>The game quickly blossomed. The Geelong Football Club was formed in 1859 and in 1866 an updated set of rules
            was put in place and competition started.</p>
        <p>The Victorian Football League was established in 1896 and the following year the League’s first games were
            played among the foundation clubs – Carlton,
            Collingwood, Essendon, Fitzroy, Geelong, Melbourne, St Kilda and South Melbourne.</p>
        <p>In 1908, Richmond and University joined the competition. But after the 1914 season, University left the
            League.
            In 1925, Footscray (now the Western Bulldogs), Hawthorn and North Melbourne joined the VFL.</p>
        <p>This line-up of 12 clubs would remain unchanged until 1987 when the competition expanded to include the West
            Coast Eagles and the Brisbane Bears. By 1997, the competition comprised 16 clubs after Adelaide (in 1991),
            Fremantle (in 1995), and Port Adelaide (in 1997) joined the now Australian Football League and foundation
            club Fitzroy merged with the Brisbane Bears to form the Brisbane Lions (after the 1996 season).
            In 2011 the Gold Coast Suns joined the competition, followed by the
            Greater Western Sydney Giants, creating the 18-team national competition we see today.</p>
